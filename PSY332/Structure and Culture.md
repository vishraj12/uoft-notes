#### Dark-side of workplace culture
##### 4 Mistakes of Workplace Culture
- Toxicity: (helicopter parenting)
	- Significant personal conflicts
	- Focus on results at the expense of people 
	- Little accountability for poor treatment of workers
- Mediocracy: (no balls to confront)
	- Focus on relationships over results
	- Little accountability for performance and lack of results
- Bureaucracy: (strict rat)
	- A focus on rules and regulation at the expense of innovation
	- Lots of red tape and tradition
- Anarchy:
	- Not enough rules and procedures in place
	- Lack of strategic planning and coordination 
	- CHAOSSSSSS
##### Organizational Culture Strength
- Different types:
	- Strong Culture: Proud of their organization
	- Weak Culture: Not proud of their organization
	- Organizational Subcultures: Proud of their department
	- Differentiated Culture: Has two different strong cultures in the organization
- Definition: How widely and deeply employees hold the company's dominant values and assumptions
	- Crystallization: extent of agreement
	- Intensity: how strongly values are held and enforced
- Strong cultures exist when:
	- Most employees understand/embrace the dominant values
	- Values and assumptions are institutionalized through well-established artifacts and norms
- Contributors to Strong Cultures:
	- Leaders/Founders: Initial model of beliefs, values and assumptions (especially of transformational leaders)
	- Socialization: Norms and culture are communicated to new employees who adopt and perpetuate these
##### Strong Culture Properties
Assets:
- Differentiate organization from others
- Source of identification 
- Coordination 
- Stability
Liabilities:
- May not stand out in a good way
- Culture clash, exclusion, and/or lack of diversity
- Resistance to Change
Ideally need a culture that is strong and flexible -> paradox
#### Organizational Culture
##### Definition
- The basic pattern of shared values, beliefs, norms and assumptions governing the way employees within an organization think about and act on problems and opportunities
	- May not hold these values and norms in another setting
	- Learned through social interaction in the organization
##### What Organizational Cultures Do:
1. Defines boundaries between organizations
2. Conveys a positive sense of identity
3. Facilitates commitment to the organization
4. Enhances the stability of the social system
5. Is a sense-making and control mechanism for fitting employees in the organization
##### Dimensions of Culture
1. Innovation
2. Stability
3. Respect for people
4. Outcome orientation
5. Attention to detail 
6. Team orientation 
7. Aggressiveness
In an organizational setup, values-upholding low-level characters and values-violating high-level characters are noticed the most.
##### Organizational Symbols
- Language -> Leaders use phrases and special vocabulary as cultural symbols
- Physical structures and symbols -> Represent a certain vibe
- Stories/Legends -> Social prescriptions of desired/undesired behaviour
##### Schein's Model of Organizational Culture
- Artifacts (Visible)
- Norms and Values (Visible/Invisible)
- Shared Assumptions (Invisible)
#### Organizational Change
##### Definition 
- Organizational Change involves a company making adjustments to its processes, structure, technologies or culture to deal with new market dynamics, internal challenges or opportunities.
- Can look like major shifts to:
	- Personnel
	- Company goals
	- Service offerings
	- Operations
- Necessary due to:
	- External: Environmental jolts, changing market, digital transformation, sociopolitical events
	- Internal: Turnover, strikes, low productivity, conflict, bureaucracy
- 2 types of changes:
	- Adaptive Changes: Small, incremental changes adopted to address needs that evolve over time
	- Transformational Changes: Larger in scale/scope and involve major/simultaneous shifts in mission, strategy, structure, performance and process
##### Lewin's Change Process
- Unfreezing: Current situation recognized as unsatisfactory 
- Changing: Plan or program is implemented to bring about a more satisfactory state
- Refreezing: When new behaviours/structures become established
- Organizational Change Process:
	- Diagnosis -> Unfreeze -> Resistance -> Change -> Refreeze -> Evaluation, Institutionalization
- Kotter's 8-step Model:
	1. Create urgency 
	2. Build a coalition
	3. Create a vision
	4. Communicate the vision
	5. Empower others
	6. Create quick wins
	7. Build on the change
	8. Embed the change
