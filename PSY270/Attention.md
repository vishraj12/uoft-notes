- Attention is the process of concentrating mental effort on sensory or mental events
	- Limited capacity
	- Varies along certain dimensions
		- Exogenous-endogenous
			- Exogenous is external control, while endogenous attention is internal control
		- Overt-covert
			- Overt attention is visibly focusing on something while covert attention is not visibly focusing
		- Automatic-controlled 
			- More attention for control
- Attention is closely linked to consciousness but they are not synonymous 
	- Change blindness: Happens when people fail to notice large changes in their visual environment
	- Inattentional blindness: Happens when people fail to notice an unexpected object in plain sight 
#### Attention is Driven By:
- Salient stimulus
	- Motion
	- Colour
	- Brightness
	- Contrast
	- Orientation
- Attention can be driven by other important information and previous knowledge
#### Filter Theories of Attention
- Selective Attention:
	- Filter theories believe attention acts like a bottleneck that only lets some information through at a time -> the attentional filter selects attended information for processing and filters out everything else
- Dichotic Listening Task: Psychological test where two different auditory stimuli are presented simultaneously -> investigates selective attention
	- People did not notice the meaning of the message in the unattended ear but they noticed that sensory information was being provided
- Broadbent's Early Selection Filter Model: Input -> Sensory Memory -> Filter -> Detector -> Long-term Memory
	- Proposed on the basis of results from dichotic listening tasks
	- Problems:
		- People are aware of their own name in an unattended message
		- Participants follow a meaningful message in the unattended ear
- Triesman's Attenuation Model: Attenuator -> Dictionary Unit -> Memory
	- Same as Broadbent's
	- Attended signal is stronger than other stimuli after passing through the filter but 
		- Unattended stimuli mahy be more intense, important or likely
#### Capacity Theories of Attention
- Divided Attention:
	- Fixed amount of attentional resources that we can use to perform mental work 
		- More cognitive load = more attentional resources used
		- Have some control over how we allot these resources
	- Flanker Compatibility Task: Demonstrates attention spill-over with low load tasks 
- With practice controlled processes can become automatic:
	- Automatic Processes:
		- Do not require attention
		- Fast
		- Parallel
		- Can't be modified once started
	- Controlled Processes:
		- Require attention
		- Slow
		- Serial
		- Under conscious control
- Stroop Task: Individuals have difficulty naming the ink color of a word where the word represents a different colour
- While driving, we are less able to detect sudden changes or react quickly when using cell phones 
- Cowan suggests we can attend $4 \pm 1$ items at one time -> multi-object tracking 
#### Attention as a Spotlight
- Vigilance
- Attention acts like a unitary spotlight, moving through space
- Valid trial: Cue correctly predicts the target's location -> faster/more accurate performance
- Invalid trial: Cue misleads the participant, pointing to the wrong location
- Neutral trial: Provides no information about the target's location -> baseline
- We can selectively attend objects in the same spatial location
#### Attention as a Feature Binder
- From research in visual perception and questions from philosophy, attention researchers are faced with the binding problem
	- How do separate features combine into a single object?
	- How do brain processes construct phenomenological experience?
- Patient data indicates that object feature identification can occur without binding -> item features outside of conscious awareness are not bound
- Therefore, one role of attention may be to bind features 
- Visual search tasks involves using attention to focus on object features in a particular location 
	- Feature Search: Searching for one feature
	- Conjunction Search: Searching for multiple features together
- Usually, a visual search task in a lab has 3 independent variables:
	- Type of search 
	- Number of distractors 
	- Presence of target
	- Dependent Variable -> Reaction time to respond
- According to feature integration theory, visual search is a 2-stage process
	1. Single feature does not require attention and 'pops out' automatically -> preattentive stage
	2. Binding features requires attention -> focused attention stage
- Object -> Preattentive Stage -> Focused Attention Stage -> Perception
