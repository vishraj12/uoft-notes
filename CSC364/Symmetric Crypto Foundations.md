#### History
- Caesar Cipher:
	- Among the earliest cryptographic schemes
	- Key Generation -> Between 0-25
	- Enc(K,M) -> Shift each letter in the message forward by K positions
	- Dec(K,C) -> Shift each letter in the ciphertext backward by K positions
	- Can be solved by brute-forcing or leveraging the English language
- Substitution Cipher:
	- Each letter is mapped to a different letter -> no constant shift
	- Key Generation -> create a random, one-to-one mapping of all 26 items
	- Enc(K,M) -> Replace each letter in the message using mapping K
	- Dec(K,C) -> Replace each ciphertext letter using the reverse mapping
	- Can be solved by brute-forcing, CPA and Cryptoanalysis (exploiting patterns in English)
- Rotor Ciphers: 
	- Mechanical encryption devices using rotating wheels
	- Popular in late 19th and early 20th centuries
	- Famous example: Enigma
		- Used 3-5 rotors -> Each rotor = fixed letter permutation
		- Ended with a reflector -> sent signal back through rotors
		- Included a plugboard -> extra letter swaps before/after rotors
		- Mechanism:
			- Press a key -> current passes through plugboard, rotors, reflector and then back -> light up output letter
			- After each key press, first rotor advances
			- Full rotation carries into the next rotor
		- How Enigma Encryption Worked:
			- Choose rotors, rotor order, initial positions and plugboard wiring
			- Key Space = $2^{67}$
			- Enc/Dec -> Input rotor settings K into Enigma and type each letter -> lampboard shows encrypted output 
		- Faults:
			- Known plaintext attacks: Germans often sent predictable text
			- Kerckhoff's Principle: Security relied on the machine
			- Chosen-plaintext attacks: Allies could provoke predictable responses
			- Brute-force: 
			- Design weakness: No letter ever encrypted to itself -> narrowed search 
#### Modern Cryptography
- Mathematical era: Security dependent on rigor not obscurity
- Public-key revolution -> Number theory in cryptography -> Focus of the course
- 2 models of keys:
	- Symmetric key model: Alice and Bob both know the value of the same key
	- Asymmetric key model: Each user has a secret key and a public key
#### 3 Goals of Cryptography (CIA)
- Confidentiality -> Prevents adversaries from reading our messages
	- Better definition: [[IND-CPA]]
- Integrity -> Prevents adversaries from modifying messages undetected
- Authenticity -> Ensures a message really comes from the claimed sender
	- Authenticity requires integrity
#### Kerckhoff's Principle
- Security must depend on the secrecy of keys not the secrecy of the design. 
- No security through obscurity -> assume attacker knows the system
- Key should be the only secret -> everything is tested encouraging open standards and peer review
- If a key is leaked, easier to replace the key than the system
- Shannon's Maxim -> attacker knows the algorithms (Related to this)
#### Threat Models
- Ciphertext-Only Attack: Attacker has access only to ciphertexts (no plaintexts)
	- Interrupting encrypted messages
- Known-Plaintext Attack (KPA): Attacker knows some plaintext-ciphertext pairs but can't choose them
	- Frequency analysis on substitution ciphers
- Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA): Attack can choose arbitrary plaintexts and obtain corresponding ciphertexts
	- Submitting messages to an encryption oracle and observing outputs
- Chosen-Ciphertext Attack (CCA): Attacker can choose arbitrary ciphertexts and corresponding plaintexts (decryption oracle) but not the ciphertext.
