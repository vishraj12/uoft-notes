#### Organizational Structure
- Division of labour and patterns of coordination, communication, workflow, and formal power that direct organizational activities
- Manner in which an organization divides its labour into specific tasks and achieves coordination among these tasks
##### Vertical Division
- Tall organizations (Many layers in the organization)
##### Horizontal Division
- Flat organizations (Few layers in the organization)
##### 4 Elements of Organizational Structure
1. Span of Control -> number of employees supervised by one manager
	- Greater span for work with more standardized processes
	- Span generally decreases as one moves up the hierarchy
	- Flatter structures have larger span of control (holding size constant)
2. Centralization -> Formal decision making authority is held by a few people at the top
	- Decentralization (Opposite) -> Decision making authority is dispersed throughout the organization
3. Formalization -> Degree to which organizations standardize behaviour through rules, procedures, formal training and related mechanisms
	- Increases as firms get older, larger and more regulated
	- Pros:
		- Provides clear standards of operation
		- Documentation helps with onboarding new members
		- Can enhance efficiency
		- Allows quality control
	- Cons:
		- Reduces flexibility
		- Discourage learning/creativity
		- Can reduce efficiency
		- Increases stress/dissatisfaction
4. Departmentation
	- Specifies how employees and their activities are grouped together (e.g. cs department)
	- 3 functions of departmentalization: 
		- Establishes chain of command
		- Creates common mental models, measures of performance etc
		- Encourages coordination through informal communication
	- Different types of Departmentation: 
		- Functional Departmentation -> president + vice presidents
		- Product Departmentation -> president + hardware + software + teams under them (an example)
		- Geographic Departmentation -> president + vice presidents in different regions + production under them
			- Customer Departmentation -> president + vice president for sales + finance, marketing and production under them
		- Matrix Departmentation -> cross-functional departmentation
			- president + vice president + product managers dealing with different sections
			- Functional influence and product influence cross-section
			- Employees are temporarily assigned to a
