#### Definition
- Study of how the external world gets represented in our brain so that we can understand and act upon what's going on around us
#### Agnosia
- Agnosia is a deficit in recognition despite normal vision 
- Apperceptive Agnosia: People are unable to name, match or discriminate visually presented objects -> considered as a type of 'blindness' as they are functionally not literally blind 
	- Since patients can't combine basic visual information into a complete precept therefore they show deficits in copying as well
- Associative Agnosia: Can combine visual features into a whole (can copy well) but can't associate a visual pattern with meaning -> can't recognize what they see
	- Their copying is better than the normal person's as they don't have a concept of what they are drawing so they draw it meticulously
	- Memory captures the concept of things -> just can't match it to something else
#### Steps to Visual Perception
- Input/Sensation
- Basic visual components assembled
- Meaning is linked to visual input
#### Experience Error
- What you see isn't what you get
	- A lot of filtering/processing before the information reaches consciousness
- Experience Error is the false assumption that the structure of the world is directly given from our senses
- Visual illusions illustrate that we don't always perceive an accurate representation of a visual stimulus
- We do not see a continuous image of the world -> our eyes follow a series of fixation-saccade cycles
	- saccade -> fast jerking moment, from one point to another
		- visual perception is suppressed 
		- on/off but our brain doesn't process it as that
		- not accurate to what you're perceiving 
	- fixation -> smooth pursuit movement 
		- usually accurate to what you're perceiving
#### Approaches to Study Perception
- Computational Approach: Concerned with discovering how the brain represents and interprets the distal stimulus (physical stimulus in the environment -> we don't have direct access to it, sensation of what we are perceiving)
	- Bottom-up and top-down processing
		- Bottom-up (data driven)
			- We recognize patterns by analyzing sensory input step-by-step
			- Cons:
				- Analyzing each feature one at a time takes a long time
				- Theories that rely on features can't explain within category discrimination 
				- Pattern recognition can depend on top-down/conceptually driven effects
		- Top-down (conceptually driven)
			- Perception is influenced by our prior knowledge, memories and experiences 
			- We use what we know about physical properties of the world to perceive 3D objects from 2D images
			- We use what we know about how the world is structured to perceive 3D objects from 2D images
	- Idea #1: Template Theory (Outdated + used for computers only) (Bottom-up)
		- According to template theory, we have a mental 'stencil' for an array of different patterns
		- Problem: 
			- Works well in an controlled environment with computers, however, 
			- How do we predict all possible options? (different fonts, sizes etc.)
	- Idea #2: Feature Matching (Bottom-up)
		- We try to match features and we have a system for analyzing each distinct feature of a visual item
		- Pandemonium (Selfridge, 1959)
		- Serial and Parallel Processing
		- Problem: Don't know how to reconfigure features again + only describes 2D objects, can't process 3D objects
		- Physiological support for feature matching comes from discovery of feature detector neurons in primary visual cortex
	- Idea #3: Biederman's Recognition by Components (Bottom-up)
		- Used to address computer vision (believed this is how human vision worked)
		- Geons are the basic components of 3D objects. They are view-point invariant can recognize geons from any angle) because they have nonaccidental properties (properties that belong to the object and not just perceived by accident) -> but recognition is impaired when we view objects from non-canonical (unusual) viewpoints 
	- Idea #4: View-based Recognition (Bottom-up)
		- RBC comes from a long history of computational theories that were not concerned with describing the physical implementation of such systems in humans
		- Evidence from psychology and physiology does not support a viewpoint invariant approach to object identification
		- Human appear to have a viewer centered bias
			- Object recognition is faster from familiar viewpoints
			- Cortical neurons demonstrate viewpoint specificity
- Gestalt Approach: Uses organizational principles to create meaningful perception of the environment
- Perception/action Approach: Assumes the goals of action help determine perception
- Proximal Stimulus: What we do have access to -> representation of what we perceive
- Major difference between approaches is whether the goal of perception is recognition or action 
#### Gestalt (Bottom-up)
- Gestalt psychology is concerned with how perception gets organized into meaningful units
- 'The whole is different than the sum of its parts'
- Gestalt grouping principles identify characteristics of perception which help determine which components of a stimulus group together
- We can use these rules to predict what will be perceived based on one law at a time, it is hard to predict the outcome of combining laws -> still remarkably robust
- Law of Proximity: Items that are close together are grouped together 
	- Any similarities cause items to be grouped together (e.g. colour, size, distance)
- Law of Common Region: Items within a common region are grouped together
- Role of Experience: If things have been associated in prior viewings, they will be grouped together in the future
#### Perception/Action
- The embodied cognition approach came from Gibson's 'direct perception' approach
- The environment contains all the information we need for perception
- The goal of perception is an action 
- Laboratory experiments (using 2D images) only study indirect perception
- The ambient optic array is the structure imposed on light by the environment and contains all the information we need for perception 
- Motion is necessary to 'pick up' the required information from the optic array
- Motion is described by optic flow in the ambient optic array: 
	1. If there is flow in the optic array, the observer is in motion
	2. The direction of flow indicates the direction the observer is moving
- According to Gibson, the goal of perception is not a visual description of the world, it's an action 
- The goal of perception is to provide a perceiver with information about objects' affordances 
- Gibson's direct perception is an extreme approach in which affordances directly connect perception and action without the need for intervening cognitive processes
	- No perceptual representation (no proximal stimulus)
	- No role of memory (no top-down processing)
- Unlike Gibson's view, most modern researchers believe both action and representations are involved in perception, but that action influences how we perceive the world
- Evidence from lesion studies suggests that there are 2 anatomical pathways for object recognition
	- Dorsally through the Parietal Lobe
	- Imaging studies have revealed different areas of activation for perception of faces, places, and objects
- Deficits in motion perception and action have been dissociated from object identification 
	- Ideomotor Apraxia (damage to 'where' pathway)
	- Agnosia's result from damage to the 'what' pathway
	- Blindsight is a result of cortical damage to visual areas and results in a dissociation of visual recognition and vision for action
