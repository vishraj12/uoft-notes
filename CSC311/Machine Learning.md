With most programs, it is difficult to program the correct behavior by hand:
- Recognizing people and objects
- Understanding human speech

[[Machine Learning vs. Statistics]]
#### Machine learning approach: ####
Uses linear algebra, probability theory, numerical optimization and statistics to create programs that automatically learn from data, or from experience

#### Why a learning algorithm is useful: ####
- Hard to code up a solution by hand (e.g. vision, speech)
- System needs to adapt to a changing environment (e.g. spam detection)
- Want the system to perform better than the human programmers
- privacy/fairness (e.g. ranking search results)

#### 3 types of Machine Learning: ####
- [[Supervised Learning]]
- [[Unsupervised Learning]]
- [[Reinforcement Learning]]

#### Neural Net Frameworks ####
- This includes PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc:
	- automatic differentiation
	- compiling computation graphs
	- libraries of algorithms and network primitives
	- support for graphics processing units (GPUs)
