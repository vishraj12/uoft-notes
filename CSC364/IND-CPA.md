#### Definition:
- Indistinguishability under CPA 
- Threat Model: adversary can launch a CPA -> can request encryptions of arbitrary messages of their choice
- Game: adversary submits two equal-length messages $M_0$, $M_1$ -> Challenger encrypts one at random and returns the ciphertext
- Requirement: adversary can't distinguish what is encrypted except with probability 1/2 + negligible 
- Formalized as games adversaries try to win
- Adversary wins if it correctly guesses whether $M_0$ or $M_1$ was encrypted
- Don't assume a specific strategy -> represent all possible strategies
- Baseline: If randomly guessing -> success probability = $1/2$
- Insecurity: Strategy with success > $1/2$ -> ciphertext leaks information
- Security: Efficient adversaries, success <= $1/2$ + negligible
- Negligible Advantage:
	- e.g with a k-bit key, advantages = $O(1/2^k)$
	- Rule of Thumb: $2^{80}$ work is currently infeasible -> but security thresholds evolve with time and threat models
