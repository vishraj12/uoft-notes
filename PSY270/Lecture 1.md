Cognitive Psychology: Study of intelligent behaviour -> can be humans, animals, machines etc but this is relevant to humans
- Behaviour is observed to infer through because much of cognition is unconscious and more complex than it seems initially
- The mind was considered as part of the soul and impossible to study -> early research in perception inspired others to approach the study of the mind scientifically
#### The Scientific Study of the Mind
##### Wilhelm Wundt and Structuralism (1832-1920)
- He wanted to know about the 'structure' of different things
- Considered as the first psychologist
- He investigated the elements of immediate experience via analytic introspection (controlled observations of internal thoughts)
	- Using the scientific method -> man tried his best but it's not considered very scientific
	- If different people's thoughts align on a specific entity -> means that it actually exists in real life -> not very scientific
- Developed some of the first ideas about:
	- Experimentation
	- Attention
	- Memory 
	- Language -> Wundt created the linguistic trees
- Titchener brought Wundt's ideas to America in the the form of structuralism, including controversies about Wundt's techniques
- Titchener thought he was always right -> removes any scientific rigour
##### William James and Functionalism (1842 - 1910)
- Father of American psychology
	- Man studied medicine so that he wouldn't run out of money
	- Attended Wundt's lectures -> Fascinated but did not agree with Wundt
	- He did not actually do any experiments ->only thought experiments
	- His thought experiments have been replicated -> their basis have been supported by modern theories
- Functionalism is studying the purpose of thought and not the elements of it
- Concerned with prediction and control through direct observation-> what we get from consciousness
- Wrote the Principles of Psychology
	- Man was super insecure but other people thought his words were the shit
##### 4 key principles of the Scientific Method:
- Empiricism -> We need to observe what we are studying
- Determinism -> Assumption that what we are observing has a cause
- Testability -> Be able to test a theory
- Parsimony -> Always assume the simplest explanation until you have evidence proving otherwise
- Problems with this: 
	- Have to study the observable by inferring unobservable entities (e.g. gravity, atoms, the mind)
	- To be scientifically accepted, the unobservable should do something useful
#### Behaviourism
- Offers a way to study publicly observable functions of the mind
- Ivan Pavlov (1849 - 1936) described the groundwork for early behaviourism: Classical Conditioning
	- Salivating dogs -> Pavlovian response
- John Watson (1878-1958) was concerned with behaviour as a series of stimuli and responses 
	- Brain processes are unimportant (black box -> it doesn't matter for us)
	- Animals can be a good substitute to study human behaviour
- B.F. Skinner (1904-1990) developed operant conditioning -> behaviour modification still used today
	- punishment/reward
- E.C. Tolman(1886-1959) did not believe behaviour to be a black box kind of thing
	- Saw learning as latent (no reward/punishment)
	- Rat Experiment: 
		- 3 phases: Exploring the maze, turn right for food, turn left for food
		- According to behaviourism, there should be no learning as no reward/punishment
		- However, rats were able to navigate the maze to follow the food and not learning to turn left/right
			- Behaviour isn't just being learned, it can be mental + the rat had explored the maze 
- Noam Chomsky (1928 -) did not believe language could simply be a result of stimulus and response 
	- Poverty of stimulus argument -> no argument that children get enough stimulus to learn language according to behaviour techniques
	- Poverty of Stimulus is impossible for behaviourists to explain
	- Behaviourism had a major impact on modern psychology as the scientific study of behaviour
##### Cognitivism and Computers
- WWII was a changing point for psychology as research was needed that had practical applications in the field
- Attention, problem-solving and decision-making were of primary interest
- Computers were being developed to replace humans in wars
- Alan Turing (1912-1954) proposed the Turing Machine 
	- Goal was to carry out what the human mind can do
- A computer is a machine that uses a function to produce an output based on an input
- Newell and Simon were among the first to design a 'non-war' computer program 
	- Logic Theorist (1956) was the first thinking machine
- Neissers 1967 book, Cognitive Psychology, relied heavily on ideas from tech
	- Psychologists could propose models to explain unobservable mental functions, make predictions and test them using computers
##### Themes in Cognitive Psychology
1. Representationalism -> We assume that the thought is something special and different from the physical world
	- Cognition may be caused by the brain but that's not what it's about
	- Aboutness of mental processes involves representations that stand for what the processes are about in the real world 
		- Perception are about the physical world; they represent objects in the physical world
		- Thoughts represent possible real situations
- Computationalism -> If computers process information and information processing is what characterizes minds, then mind is computational (Marr)
	- Input -> Store -> Manipulate -> Output
	- Information processing systems use rule-based operators to move from one state to the next -> goal is to discover what the function is that allows the progression from input to output
	- Symbol systems are representational and computational (they are about something and can be manipulated according to rules)
	- Mind is a symbol system (Newell)
	- Modern cognitive psychology is all based on the assumptions that the mind operates by manipulating symbols that represent thoughts
		- Even theories that reject this idea are only around because of these ideas in the first place
- Biologicalism -> Biological perspective have taught us about the functions of brain and cognitive functions
	- Has a basis in computation
	- Connectionism is an alternate theory of computing that is based on the idea that information is carried in connected neuron-like structures (neural networks)
- Embodiment -> Need to experience the world for consciousness
	- Symbol systems face the grounding problem -> what about what's outside of the mind?
	- In AI, robots am to overcome the problem, humans can interact with the physical world to circumvent the grounding problem -> representationalism doesn't explain how this happens
	- Embodied cognition believes information is given by perceptual, motor and emotional activity by the body in the real world (maybe eliminating the need for representations)
##### Research Methods
- Case Studies
- Correlational Studies
- Experiments
- Computer simulations
##### Experimentation
- IV is manipulated by the experimeter
- DV is measured and dependent on IV
	- Most common DV in cognitive psychology are usually accuracy and reaction time
- Researchers create and test hypotheses that the IV will cause a change in DV
- Researchers try to avoid confounding variables
- Use representative and random samples
- Ideally participants should be randomly assigned to different levels of IV
- Many cog psych experiments are quasi-experimental in which random assignment of the independent variable is not possible
	- Can't randomly assign participants to two groups (e.g. randomly assigning people to male and female groups -> technically not an experiment)
